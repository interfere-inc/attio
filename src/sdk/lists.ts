   * @remarks
   * Creates a new list.

   * Once you have your list, add attributes to it using the [Create attribute](/rest-api/endpoint-reference/attributes/create-an-attribute) API, and add records to it using the [Add records to list](/rest-api/endpoint-reference/entries/create-an-entry-add-record-to-list) API.
   *
   * New lists must specify which records can be added with the `parent_object` parameter which accepts either an object slug or an object ID. Permissions for the list are controlled with the `workspace_access` and `workspace_member_access` parameters.
   *
   * Please note that new lists must have either `workspace_access` set to `"full-access"` or one or more element of `workspace_member_access` with a `"full-access"` level. It is also possible to receive a `403` billing error if your workspace is not on a plan that supports either advanced workspace or workspace member-level access for lists.

Changing the parent object of a list is not possible through the API as it can have unintended side-effects that should be considered carefully. If you wish to carry out a parent object change you should do so through the UI.

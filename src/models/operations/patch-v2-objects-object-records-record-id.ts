   * A timestamp value represents a single, universal moment in time using an ISO 8601 formatted string. This means that a timestamp consists of a date, a time (with nanosecond precision), and a time zone. Attio will coerce timestamps which do not provide full nanosecond precision and UTC is assumed if no time zone is provided. For example, "2023", "2023-01", "2023-01-02", "2023-01-02T13:00", "2023-01-02T13:00:00", and "2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000" will all be coerced to "2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000Z". Timestamps are always returned in UTC. For example, writing a timestamp value using the string "2023-01-02T13:00:00.000000000+02:00" will result in the value "2023-01-02T11:00:00.000000000Z" being returned.

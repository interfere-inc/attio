# ListTasksSort

Optionally sort the results. "created_at:asc" returns oldest results first, "created_at:desc" returns the newest results first. "completed_at:asc" and "completed_at:desc" sort by completion time. With "completed_at:asc", incomplete tasks (no completion date) appear first, followed by completed tasks oldest-first. With "completed_at:desc", completed tasks appear first (newest-first), followed by incomplete tasks. To exclude incomplete tasks, filter by is_completed. If unspecified, defaults to "created_at:asc" (oldest results first).

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { ListTasksSort } from "@interfere/attio/models/operations";

let value: ListTasksSort = "created_at:desc";
```

## Values

```typescript
"created_at:asc" | "created_at:desc" | "completed_at:asc" | "completed_at:desc"
```
